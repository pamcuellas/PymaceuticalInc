## PymaceuticalsInc Analysis

The objective of this project was to analyze a dataset that contains information about squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, and its possible treatments.

During 45 days, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes, their physiological responses were monitored throughout that time, and all data was collected.

A jupyter notebook was created to compare four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) through creating a scatter plots to shows how the tumour volume changes over time for each treatment, how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment, the number of mice still alive through the course of therapy (Survival Rate) and a bar graph that compares the total % tumour volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
